# Steam-Data-Activity-Prediction
Hello!
This is my first ML project where I try uncovering patterns within the gaming community by predicting how many potential hours one might put in based on activity and engagement. This will be done using a Linear Regression model.

## Requirements
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Data
The was originally sourced from popular pc gaming marketplace called 'Steam'. The data we will be focusing on are:
- player_ID
- Game_Title
- Hours_Played

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamber/steam-video-games)


## Methodology
- Data Exploration
- Linear Regression

## Results
Accuracy score was very low suggesting insufficient data or the right machine learning model was not used.
